# "upower --enumerate | grep 'BAT'" gets the battery name (e.g.,

# "upower --show-info" prints battery information from which we get
# the state (such as "charging" or "fully-charged") and the battery's
# charge percentage. With awk, we cut away the column containing
# identifiers. i3 and sway convert the newline between battery state and
# the charge percentage automatically to a space, producing a result like
# "charging 59%" or "fully-charged 100%".

# "amixer -M" gets the mapped volume for evaluating the percentage which

# is muted or not.
# "tr -d []" removes brackets around the volume.
